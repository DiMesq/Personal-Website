$about = "<p>Hello, I'm Diogo! As you might have noticed I am studying computer science. Perhaps, even more 
		  characterizing, I should say that I love to code!</p>

		  <p>In summary (cliché as it may seem) I want to contribute as best as 
		  I can to the improvement of society in general.</p>

		  <p>For this purpose, I think that, right now, dedicating my time to Computer Science is 
		  what will provide me the best opportunity of doing so. In particular, I am really interested
		  in Machine Learning. The recent applications that emerged in the past few years
		  by advancements in the field, such has Deep Learning, really excite and 
		  inspire me, specially the fact that so much more is possible.</p>";
